## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for a keyword
- Be able to read and hear the word's phonetics
- Be able to read the word's definition, used in sentence form including examples
- Be able to see photos related to that keyword

## My process

### Built with

- React (state management)
- Axios API Integration - 2 different APIs - Dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and Pexels photo API (https://www.pexels.com/api/)
- HTML
- CSS properties, CSS Grid, CSS Module
- Reusable Components
- Mobile-first responsive workflow

### What I learned

I practiced React forms, using state and the map function multiple times. I practiced how to work with two APIs. I practiced incorporating a reusable card component.

### Continued development

I would like to add validation like what happens if a user submits an empty form or a word not found in the dictionary API.
