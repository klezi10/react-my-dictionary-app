## My process

### Built with

- React
- API Integration - 2 different APIs - Dictionary API and Pexels photo API
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced React forms, using state and the map function multiple times. I practiced how to work with two APIs.

### Continued development

I would like to add validation like what happens if a user submits an empty form.
